# Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis
In this case study, I work for a fictional company named Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago as a Junior Data Analyst in the marketing team.

About the Company
Cyclistic Bike-Share, Chicago is a bike-share program launched in 2016 that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 1200 docking stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

About the Team
The marketing team is a team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide the Cyclistic marketing strategy.

Background of the Case-study
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that member riders are much more profitable than casual riders but the director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team is tasked with understanding how casual and member riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into member riders.

Business Task
Design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into member riders.

Goal Insights
­­ ­­­1. How casual riders and member riders use Cylistic bikes differently.

­ 2. Why casual riders would buy a membership

­ 3. How digital media could affect their marketing tactics

Prepare
The Cyclistic’s historical trip data was used to analyze and identify trends. This data was supplied by amazonaws.com and the12 months (July 2021 — June 2022) of Cyclistic trip data selected for use can be found here. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company).

The data which was gathered firsthand by the company on all its users has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. The data-privacy issues prohibit my team and me from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that we won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

For this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable me to answer the business questions irrespective of the data privacy involved. Information like membership types, duration of trips, start and end stations and so on which were supplied will be used to show helpful insights into riders’ patterns.

The data was supplied in CSV files and were zipped according to their respective months. The data used consists of 5, 900, 385 rows, and 13 columns. In terms of clean data, this dataset is quite dirty because it has several nulls (blank) values.
